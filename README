This is a prototype particle system written in javascript, with a run-once component written in C++.  
It takes an image (I used a logo) and samples the image, creating a JSON array of colors.  
The JSON file is used to make squares of solid colors that then can be moved around the canvas using some dojo library calls.
There are a few knobs that you can twidle with in the javascript.  Most of the constants are defined in all caps.  
You can also choose to use square (solid colors), circles, or images (squares with image tiles).
Finally, if you type in 

ps.leafBlower=true;

into the JS console, the particles will loose their spring constants to snap back to their resting place.
